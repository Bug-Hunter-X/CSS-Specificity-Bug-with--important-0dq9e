The solution avoids using !important and instead uses a more specific selector to override the conflicting style.  This is often a cleaner and more maintainable approach to resolving style conflicts. 
```css
#container {
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#container p {
  color: blue; /* this should override the color below, but it doesn't with bug.css*/
}
p {
  color: red !important;/*this is overriding the more specific selector above*/
}
```

```css
#container {
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#container p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```
